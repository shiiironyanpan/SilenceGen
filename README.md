> ## Solana Wallet Generator. Creating the address and private key of the Solana wallet. Automatically generate seed phrases and check balances for Solana networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the wallet's information (address, mnemonic, private key, and balances) is logged and saved to a file named result.txt.
